# About
Highly motivated Psychology graduate (First Class Honours) from the University of Sussex with a keen interest for combining my psychological insights with data analysis. Recently presented a poster about my dissertation research project at the Researchers of Statistics Education (RoSE) 2023 Conference. Interned at the data analytics company Datacove over the summer, using the programming language R. Currently studying a Master of Research in Psychological Methods at the University of Sussex.

# Psychological Methods MRes Projects:
## Advanced Statistics
*Spring 2024*
### Mediation
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/advanced_statistics/mediation.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/advanced_statistics/mediation.html)

Mediation analysis conducted in R using structural equation modelling. Prior simple regressions were used to determine whether the criteria for mediation was met. The first model used a combination of series and parallel mediation. The second model improved on the first, with all mediators modelled in parallel.

### Factor Analysis
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/advanced_statistics/factor_analysis.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/advanced_statistics/factor_analysis.html)

An exploratory factor analysis was conducted in which data was assessed for suitability for factor analysis, the number of factors was determined by principle component analysis-determined eigenvalues, and items were assigned to factors based on factor loadings. A confirmatory factor analysis was then conducted on a separate datset to validate the factor model.

### Meta-Analysis
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/advanced_statistics/meta_analysis.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/advanced_statistics/meta_analysis.pdf)

A meta-analysis conducted on 8 studies investigating statistics anxiety and self-esteem. A literature search was conducted and correlation coefficients were analysed and reported.

## Bayesian Statistics
*Spring 2024*
### Distributions
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/bayesian_statistics/distributions.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/bayesian_statistics/distributions.html)

Data were visualised using histograms and a bootstrapped correlation distribution was investigated to assess the correlation between reaction times and confidence scores.

### Bayesain Models
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/bayesian_statistics/bayesian_models.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/bayesian_statistics/bayesian_models.html)

A Bayesian correlation analysis was conducted between total BDI score and interoception. A Bayesian _t_-test was used to test whether participants with mood disorders have different interoception scores than those without. Finally, a Bayesian linear model predicting total BDI from interoception score, gender, and their interaction was performed.

## Programming For Experiments
*Spring 2024*
### Semantics Task in PyschoPy
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/programming_for_experiments/semantics_task.py)
 | 
[Documentation](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/programming_for_experiments/documentation.html)

A semantics task was created in PsychoPy to investigate the identification of word pairs that match based on a specific feature (high or low semantic association, colour, size, texture, or shape). Documentation is provided to install and run the experiment.

## An Adventure in Statistics
*Winter 2023*
### The Linear Model
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/an_adventure_in_statistics/the_linear_model.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/an_adventure_in_statistics/the_linear_model.html)

A linear model was fit, predicting stress from anxiety and engagement. Model fit statistics were evaluated, parameter estimates were calculated, and the assumptions of the linear model were checked. Following this, robust parameter estimates were calculated and a Bayesian model was assessed to investigate any differences from the Frequentist approach.

### The Linear Model
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/an_adventure_in_statistics/moderation.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/an_adventure_in_statistics/moderation.html)

A linear model was fit to assess whether stress was predicted by participants' intervention programme and if this effect is moderated by job role. Orthogonal contrast coding was utilised to meet the requirement of independence of predictor contrasts for the use of Type III sums of squares. Model fit statistics and parameter estimates were evaluated. Simple effects analysis was used to investigate the effect of the predictor (programme) at individual levels of the moderator (role). Assumptions of the linear model and influential cases were checked and a robust linear model was fit. 

### Multi Level Model
[Code](https://github.com/skylar-taylor/study-projects/blob/main/docs/an_adventure_in_statistics/multi_level_model.qmd)
 | 
[Writeup](https://skylar-taylor.github.io/study-projects/an_adventure_in_statistics/multi_level_model.html)

The relationship between stress and intervention programme, adjusting for burnout, was assessed over time using a multilevel model. Fixed and random effects models were fit and compared hierarchically and model parameters of the final model were assessed.
